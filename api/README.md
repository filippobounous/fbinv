# FastAPI Security Guide

Each FastAPI application is secured with its own API key that must be provided
via the `X-API-Key` HTTP header. Two environment variables control the keys:

- `FASTAPI_INVESTMENT_API_KEY`
- `FASTAPI_INVENTORY_API_KEY`

If a key is not set, the corresponding API will reject all requests.

## How it Works

The `create_api_key_dependency` helper in `api/security.py` creates a FastAPI
dependency that compares the provided header against the expected key using a
constant-time comparison. Each app declares this dependency, so every endpoint
requires the correct key.

```python
from api.security import create_api_key_dependency
from investment.config import FASTAPI_INVESTMENT_API_KEY

app = FastAPI(
    title="Investment API",
    dependencies=[Depends(create_api_key_dependency(FASTAPI_INVESTMENT_API_KEY))],
)
```

Requests without a valid key receive `401 Unauthorized`.

There is one API instance per parent module in this repository. Currently the
following apps are available:

- `api.investment.main` – endpoints for the investment module
- `api.inventory.main` – endpoints for the inventory module

Run them individually with `uvicorn`:

```bash
uvicorn api.investment.main:app --reload
uvicorn api.inventory.main:app --reload
```

## Generating Keys

You can create a strong random key using Python or OpenSSL:

```bash
python -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))'
# or
openssl rand -hex 32
```

Set the generated value in your environment or `.env` file:

```
FASTAPI_INVESTMENT_API_KEY=<your random key>
FASTAPI_INVENTORY_API_KEY=<your random key>
```

### Managing multiple keys

If you need multiple keys (for example one per client) you can generate several
values and store them in a database or file along with the owner information.
When a request arrives you can look up the supplied key and log the request
under that owner. If a key is compromised you can revoke it by removing it from
your store. Storing only hashed versions of the keys provides an extra security
layer.

## Verifying the Key

Start one of the apps with the environment variable set and make a request with
`curl`. The port defaults to `8000` but can be changed using the
`INVESTMENT_API_PORT` variable:

```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: $FASTAPI_INVESTMENT_API_KEY" \
     http://localhost:${INVESTMENT_API_PORT:-8000}/health
```

A successful response should include `{"status": "ok"}`. If the key is missing
or incorrect, the API returns `401 Unauthorized`.

See `.env.example` for all available environment variables.
